The T-Rex game is a simple browser-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a T-Rex character that the player controls by jumping over obstacles like cacti, using the spacebar. HTML is used for structuring the game layout, CSS handles the game's visual design, and JavaScript controls the game logic, including movement and collision detection. The game continues until the T-Rex hits an obstacle, ending the game.
